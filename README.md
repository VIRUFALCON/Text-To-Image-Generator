Text to Image Generator
This project is a text-to-image generator created during my first-year Summer Industrial Training Program. It utilizes AI models from Hugging Face's API to generate images based on user-provided text prompts.

Overview
The application allows users to input text prompts, which are processed by AI models to produce corresponding images. Two models, 'stable-diffusion-v1-4' and 'waifu-diffusion', are integrated to provide varied outputs.

Technologies Used
Python
Streamlit
Hugging Face API
Deployment
The project is deployed and accessible online at: Text to Image Generator

Features
Simple web interface for inputting text prompts
Integration with Hugging Face's AI models for image generation
Supports multiple AI models for diverse image outputs
Usage
To generate an image:

Enter a text prompt in the input box.
Click 'Generate Image' to see the generated image.
